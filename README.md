# ISOGAP

Allows to perform the following tasks:
1. Compute azimuthal GAP over a grid (in Colombia) taking into account the distribution of the seismological network (in this particular case, the Colombian National Seismological Network)
2. With those grids created in the previous step, generates a heatmap and a contour plot over Colombian geographical map.
